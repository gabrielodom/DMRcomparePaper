Description: The accompanying package to the method comparison paper "An
  evaluation of supervised methods for identifying differentially methylated
  regions in epigenome-wide association studies" by Mallik et al. (2018),
  submitted to Briefings in Bioinformatics as a review article. This package
  contains the organized and documented R scripts necessary to replicate the
  multi-design-point comparative simulation study, as well as associated tables
  and figures.
